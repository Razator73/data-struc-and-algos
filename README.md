# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a repository of me going through the book 
[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118290279)
by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser. I have included
notebooks that contain any of the scratch stuff I did for each chapter. An additional
notebook that covers my solutions to the exercises in each chapter.
